# React Tour Recommendation Project

## Overview

The React Tour Recommendation Project is a dynamic web application that fetches tour information (names, descriptions, prices, and pictures) from a remote URL and presents tour recommendations to the user one under the other. Users can interact with the recommendations by choosing to mark a tour as "Not Interested," revealing more details about a tour, or collapsing the additional information. When all tour recommendations have been marked as "Not Interested," a "Refresh" button allows the user to reload the list with new recommendations.

## Features
* Fetches tour data (names, descriptions, prices, and pictures) from a remote source.
* Presents tour recommendations to the user one under the other.
* Allows users to mark tours as "Not Interested," removing them from the display.
* Provides an option to view more details about each tour with the "Show More" button.
* Allows users to collapse additional tour information with the "Show Less" button.
* Offers a "Refresh" button to reload the list with new tour recommendations when all have been marked as "Not Interested."
